# Similarities between paintings and dimension reduction

Project realized as part of a course of *Geometric methods in Machine Learning* at ENSAE. Report in French.

I defined a distance between images of paintings and I embedded the images in a low dimension space with an ISOMAP algorithm. Then I trained a neural network in order to get an image based on the points in the low dimension space.
